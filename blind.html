          <br><sub>To further clarify: Do not tell me what scales well, what is OP, what I am doing wrong, or "basic mechanics" of the game. If there is something that I am missing that stops me from progressing, I will eventually ask for assistance. I'm not trying to min-max, I'm trying to experience the game. If what you are telling me is with the goal of giving me the optimal strategy or doing things "better"... I don't want to hear it. I want to have fun.</sub>
          <br><br>If I ask for a hint, give me a hint, not exactly what I should do. Please do not be demanding. 
          
            <br><sub>Demanding makes me sad :c</sub>

<h3>GOOD Button Behaviors</h3>

      <h4 class="panel-title"> If you absolutely cannot stand me missing something juicy, follow the Tonico gold standard of discrete hints:
          
        <br><br><sub>Did I miss something story essential that will be a pain in the ass to go back and grab?</sub>
          <br>Hey, did you see anything in that room back there? 
        <br><br><sub>Something neato on an upper level near where I am?</sub>
          <br>Huh... I wonder if there are any stairs around.
        
        <br><br><sub>Did I ask for a hint for the location of something that is near a dock?</sub>
          <br>Try looking near something that rhymes with flock and has to do with boats.
          
        <br><br><sub>Curious about whether I've passed a certain point in the game/have a certain item?</sub>
          <br>Can I see your completed quests/journal/inventory/map?
